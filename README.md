# Zenith Framework

Welcome to the **Zenith Framework**! Based on *Clean Architecture*, *Clean Code*, *Game Programming Patterns* and industry experience, this Unity framework is designed to help new and experienced developers start their projects faster while ensuring scalability and reliability as the codebase grows.

---

## Introduction

### Why Use Zenith Framework?

When developing medium-to-large-scale Unity projects, maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code becomes challenging. The Zenith Framework is built on principles derived from *Clean Architecture* to solve this problem, ensuring:

- **Rapid Development:** Start your projects with a solid architecture and **ready-to-use systems**, reducing the setup time.
- **Maintainability:** Easily locate and fix bugs.
- **Scalability:** Expand your game systems and add new features without breaking existing functionality.
- **Reusability:** Create reusable components that can speed up future projects.

The framework utilizes **Component** and **ServiceLocator** architectures to keep your code decoupled and flexible. It emphasizes creating modular systems, enabling developers to replace or extend functionality without widespread code changes.

---

## Core Principles

Zenith Framework is grounded in these three architectural principles:

1. **Common Closure Principle**:
   - Group classes that change for the same reason to simplify maintenance.

2. **Common Reuse Principle**:
   - Avoid dependencies on classes you don't use.

3. **Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle**:
   - Group classes to maximize reusability and minimize unnecessary coupling.

These principles ensure that your code remains clean, adaptable, and aligned with industry standards.

### Tip:
Treat the Zenith Framework like a toolâ€”test it thoroughly before fully integrating it into your project. A long-term relationship starts with a few good dates! ðŸ˜‰

## Key Concepts and Components

### 1. Service
A **Service** is a core system that provides functionality widely used across your game. Examples include:

- Object Pooling
- VFX Spawner
- Time Manager
- Screen Manager

**Why Services?**
Services are accessed via the **ServiceLocator** and use interfaces to enforce limited, controlled access. This design ensures that:

- Complex logic can be refactored without affecting dependent code.
- Systems remain decoupled for easier maintainability, testing and bugfixing.
- Replacement services can be easily swapped in with minimal changes.

**Example:** Switching from Asset Bundles to Addressables in your Object Pooling system requires only creating a new implementation of the same interface.

### 2. Entity
A **Entity** is a MonoBehaviour that manages events, data, and states within a specific context. It serves as the bridge between the **Services** and **Components**.

Entitys should:
- Hold state information relevant to a feature or system.
- Act as a hub for other **Components** to update or retrieve state data.


General application example:

---

### 3. Component
A **Component** implements the primary logic of a feature while interacting with Services or Entitys. Components are designed to:

- Focus on a single feature per class.
- Be reusable across different systems or contexts.

**Relationships with Entitys:**
1. Update the Entity's state when necessary.
2. Implement the features associated with the Entity.

This separation ensures that changes to a specific feature only affect the associated Component, leaving Entitys and Services intact.

**Example:** A `HealthComponent` manages the health logic, while the `HealthEntity` tracks and communicates health states to other systems.

---

### 4. Event Service
The **Event Service** enables decoupled communication between Components and Entitys, ensuring they remain independent and reusable.

#### How to Use the Event Service:
1. **Create Your Event Class:**
   - Create a script with the name of your event (e.g., `OnGameStartEvent`) in your `Events` folder.
   - Make this script inherit from `GameEventBase`.

   ```csharp
   public class OnGameStartEvent : GameEventBase
   {
       public string Message { get; }

       public OnGameStartEvent(string message)
       {
           Message = message;
       }
   }
   
2. **Subscribe to the event:**

   Use the IEventService.AddEventListener method to subscribe to your event. Ensure to pass your method and a unique hash code.
   
    IEventService.AddEventListener<YourEvent>(Action<YourEvent> yourMethod, GetHashCode());

3. **Invoke the event with:**

  IEventService.TryInvokeEvent(new YourEvent(data));

4. **You can unsubscribe at any time.**
To prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior, unsubscribe from events when they're no longer needed.
csharp
Copiar cÃ³digo
IEventService.RemoveEventListener<OnGameStartEvent>(GetHashCode());
   
Example Use Case: Notify all relevant systems when the game starts without creating direct dependencies between them.

#### Additional Services
The Zenith Framework includes additional ready-to-use services such as:

**Object Pooling**: Efficiently reuse objects to reduce memory allocations and improve performance.
**More Services Coming Soon!** (Stay tuned for additional services and documentation.)
