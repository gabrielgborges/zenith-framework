# Zenith Framework

Welcome to the **Zenith Framework**! Based on *Clean Architecture*, *Clean Code*, *Game Programming Patterns* and industry experience, this Unity framework is designed to help new and experienced developers start their projects faster while ensuring scalability and reliability as the codebase grows.

---

## Introduction

### Why Use Zenith Framework?

When developing medium-to-large-scale Unity projects, maintaining clean, modular, and scalable code becomes challenging. The Zenith Framework is built on principles derived from *Clean Architecture* to solve this problem, ensuring:

- **Rapid Development:** Start your projects with a solid architecture and **ready-to-use systems**, reducing the setup time.
- **Maintainability:** Easily locate and fix bugs.
- **Scalability:** Expand your game systems and add new features without breaking existing functionality.
- **Reusability:** Create reusable components that can speed up future projects.

The framework utilizes **Component** and **ServiceLocator** architectures to keep your code decoupled and flexible. It emphasizes creating modular systems, enabling developers to replace or extend functionality without widespread code changes.

---

## Core Principles

Zenith Framework is grounded in these three architectural principles:

1. **Common Closure Principle**:
   - Group classes that change for the same reason to simplify maintenance.

2. **Common Reuse Principle**:
   - Avoid dependencies on classes you don't use.

3. **Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle**:
   - Group classes to maximize reusability and minimize unnecessary coupling.

These principles ensure that your code remains clean, adaptable, and aligned with industry standards.

### Tip:
Treat the Zenith Framework like a toolâ€”test it thoroughly before fully integrating it into your project. A long-term relationship starts with a few good dates! ðŸ˜‰

## Key Concepts and Components

### 1. Service
A **Service** is a core system that provides functionality widely used across your game. Examples include:

- Object Pooling
- VFX Spawner
- Time Manager
- Screen Manager

**Why Services?**
Services are accessed via the **ServiceLocator** and use interfaces to enforce limited, controlled access. This design ensures that:

- Complex logic can be refactored without affecting dependent code.
- Systems remain decoupled for easier maintainability, testing and bugfixing.
- Replacement services can be easily swapped in with minimal changes.

**Example:** Switching from Asset Bundles to Addressables in your Object Pooling system requires only creating a new implementation of the same interface.

### 2. Entity
A **Entity** is a MonoBehaviour that manages events, data, and states within a specific context. It serves as the bridge between the **Services** and **Components**.

Entitys should:
- Hold state information relevant to a feature or system.
- Act as a hub for other **Components** to update or retrieve state data.


General application example:

---

### 3. Component
A **Component** implements the primary logic of a feature while interacting with Services or Entitys. Components are designed to:

- Focus on a single feature per class.
- Be reusable across different systems or contexts.

**Relationships with Entitys:**
1. Update the Entity's state when necessary.
2. Implement the features associated with the Entity.

![alt text](https://github.com/gabrielgborges/zenith-framework/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION/EntityComponentRelation.png?raw=true)

This separation ensures that changes to a specific feature only affect the associated Component, leaving Entitys and Services intact.

**Example:** A `HealthComponent` manages the health logic, while the `HealthEntity` tracks and communicates health states to other systems.

---

### 4. Event Service
The **Event Service** enables decoupled communication between Components and Entitys, ensuring they remain independent and reusable.

#### How to Use the Event Service:
1. **Create Your Event Class:**
   - Create a script with the name of your event (e.g., `EnableInputsEvent`) in your `Events` folder.
   - Make this script inherit from `GameEventBase`.

```csharp
public class EnableInputsEvent : GameEventBase
{
   public bool Enable { get; private set; }

   public EnableInputsEvent(bool enable)
   {
      Enable = enable;
   }
}
   ```
   
2. **Subscribe to the event:**

   - Use the IEventService.AddEventListener method to subscribe to your event (in this case: EnableInputsEvent). Ensure to pass your method and a unique hash code.
  ```csharp
public class CombatentAIComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private InputActionAsset _inputActions;
   
    private bool _isEnabled = false;
    private IEventService _eventService;

    private async void Awake()
    {
        _eventService = await ServiceLocator.GetService<IEventService>();
        _eventService.AddListener<EnableInputsEvent>(HandleEnableInputs, GetHashCode());
    }

    private void HandleEnableInputs(EnableInputsEvent inputEvent)
    {
        if (inputEvent.Enable)
        {
            // Implementation here...
        }
        else
        {
            // Different implementation here...
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Invoke the event with:**

  - IEventService.TryInvokeEvent(new YourEvent(data));
  
```csharp
public class GameSystemComponent : MonoBehaviour
{
   private bool _fightIsOn = false;

   private IEventService _eventService;

   private void Awake()
   {
      StartMatch();
   }

    private async void StartMatch()
    {
        await Task.Delay(1000);
        _eventService = await ServiceLocator.GetService<IEventService>();
        _eventService.TryInvokeEvent(new EnableInputsEvent(true));
        _fightIsOn = true;
    }
}
  ```

4. **You can unsubscribe at any time.**
   - To prevent memory leaks or unexpected behavior, unsubscribe from events when they're no longer needed.

  
   ```csharp
   public class CombatentAiComponent : MonoBehaviour
   ...
   private void OnDestroy()
    {
        _eventService.RemoveListener<EnableInputsEvent>(GetHashCode());
    }
   ```

   Example Use Case: Notify all relevant systems when the game starts without creating direct dependencies between them.

#### Additional Services
The Zenith Framework includes additional ready-to-use services such as:

**Object Pooling**: Efficiently reuse objects to reduce memory allocations and improve performance.
**More Services Coming Soon!** (Stay tuned for additional services and documentation.)

---
#### **Download the Framework Using UPM(Recommended)**

1. Open the Unity Package Manager.
2. Select the 'Add package from Git URL' option.
4. Paste  *https://github.com/gabrielgborges/zenith-framework.git*

---

#### **Add the Framework by Modifying the manifest.json File**

1. Navigate to the Packages folder in your Unity project directory and open the manifest.json file using a text editor or IDE.
2. Insert *"gabi.zenith.framework": "https://github.com/gabrielgborges/zenith-framework.git"* in the "dependencies" section of the manifest.json file.
3. Save the changes to the manifest.json file and return to Unity, it will automatically download and integrate the Zenith Framework package.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that Git is installed on your system because Unity requires Git to fetch packages directly from GitHub.
